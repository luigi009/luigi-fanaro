# Ratings

## Description

The project will show reviews of 3 products and will allow the user to filter the reviews by using the selects. I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create this project. And used the Bootstrap framework to make it responsive. To create the stars, I used the Font Awesome framework.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to train my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript. And to learn how to use the Bootstrap framework and the Font Awesome framework.

## How to open the page

To open the page, you need to open the `index.html` file in your browser. You can use any browser you want or you can use Live Server in Visual Studio Code.

## How to change the products and reviews

To change the products and reviews, you need to change the values of the `ratings` variable in the `script.js` file. The `ratings` variable is a object that contains the products and reviews. If you change the products, you need to change the HTML code in the `index.html` file. You need to change the `value` attribute of the `option` tags in the `select` tags. And you need to change the name of the product in the table body.
