# Theme Switcher

## Description

This project is a simple theme switcher. It allows you to switch between two themes. I used
languagens like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main goal of this project is to learn how to
use JavaScript to change the theme of a website.

## How to use

To use this project, you need to download the project and open the `index.html` file in your
browser or you can use Live Server in Visual Studio Code. After that, you can click on the button 'Theme' to change the theme of the website.
